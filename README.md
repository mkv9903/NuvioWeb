## WebOS Custom Proxy Setup

To bypass network restrictions and CORS issues on LG WebOS 4.x, this fork supports routing external API requests through a custom Cloudflare Worker proxy.

### 1. Set Up the Cloudflare Worker

Create a new Cloudflare Worker and paste the contents of [`cloudflare-worker/worker.js`](cloudflare-worker/worker.js) from this repository into your worker. This script handles CORS preflight requests and enforces a secret token to prevent abuse of your proxy.

Remember to replace the `EXPECTED_TOKEN` inside the worker script with your own secret string before deploying it!

### 2. Configure Your App Environment

Update your `local.properties` (or GitHub Secrets) with the worker URL and your chosen token:

```properties
WEBOS_CLOUD_PROXY_URL=https://your-worker.your-domain.workers.dev/
WEBOS_CLOUD_PROXY_TOKEN=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN
```

## Get Nuvio TV

Nuvio TV supports **Samsung Tizen TVs from 2018 onward (Tizen 4+)** and **LG webOS TVs from 2020 onward (webOS 5+)**.
On Tizen 4, some advanced audio/subtitle features may be limited, and torrent/P2P playback is unavailable by design.
On Tizen 5+ and LG webOS, torrent/P2P uses only the bundled local companion service; no external torrent streaming server is configured or required.

- [Nuvio TV Installer](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart-Installer/releases/latest) for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [Samsung Tizen WGT](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart/releases/latest) for manual installation
- [LG webOS Homebrew repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVWebOS/main/webosbrew/apps.json)
- [LG webOS IPK](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart/releases/latest) for manual installation

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart.git NuvioTVSmart
cd NuvioTVSmart
npm install
npm run build
```

Build TV packages with:

```bash
npm run package:tizen
npm run package:tizen:store
npm run package:webos
```

`package:tizen` creates the unsigned WGT used by development and the Nuvio TV Installer. The installer signs it locally for the target TV before installation. `package:tizen:store` is a separate Seller Office build: it requires Tizen Studio/Web CLI and a configured security profile, and creates the signed Store package with the local EngineFS service included so Tizen 5+ retains torrent/P2P playback. Tizen 4 still reports P2P as unsupported at runtime. Nuvio TV is built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and platform TV APIs. Building requires Node.js and npm; package installation additionally requires the relevant Tizen or webOS tools.
